.pack file notes
Data is big endian.  

Pack files have many sub packs.  Each Subpack has an 8 byte header and a list of files in the Subpack.  

Subpack Header:

First 4 bytes: uint.  offset to the next subpack. 0 denotes the last subpack.  
Second 4 bytes: uint.  number of files in the sub pack 

File List - Has a list of all files.  Each entry in the file list table is variable length, but has atleast 16 bytes of data.  

4 bytes - string length
string - File name.  Not NUL terminated.  
4 bytes -  Offset into the .pack where the file is located
4 bytes  - File Size
4 bytes - checksum

File Data

offset and size are denoted in the file list.  Just seek to the offset and read in size bytes.  

This pattern repeats multiple times until the first 4 bytes of the subpack header is 0.
